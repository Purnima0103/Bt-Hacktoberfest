    <p>Now the Web Standards Curriculum has taken you through the core essential concepts of programming, it is time to take a step back from the details and take a high-level look at what you can actually do with JavaScript — why would you want to take the time to learn such a complicated subject, and use it on your web pages?

Right now, it is difficult to get a job as a web developer without JavaScript skills.

        <h3>How people came to like JavaScript</h3>
        Computers used to be much slower and browsers were bad at interpreting JavaScript. Most developers came from a back-end development world. Back then, JavaScript just seemed like a bad idea.=======

        On the other hand, the cost of hosting files was very high. This is where JavaScript came in: JavaScript is executed on users’ computers when they access the page, meaning that anything you can do in JavaScript will not add processing strain onto your server. Hence, it is client-side. This made sites much more responsive for the end user and less expensive in terms of server traffic.

However, cutting down on server round-trips by doing things in JavaScript still results in more responsive web applications and a better user experience.

        <h1>The downside of JavaScript</h1>
        Even with all these improvements, there is still a catch: JavaScript is flaky. Not the language itself but the environment it is implemented in. You do not know what computer is on the receiving end of your web page, you do not know how busy the computer is with other things, and you do not know if some other JavaScript in another tab of the browser is grinding things down to a halt. Until browsers begin having different processing resources for different tabs and windows (also known as threads), this will always remain an issue. Multiple threading is made available to a certain degree by a new HTML5 feature called Web workers, and this has reasonable browser support.

        <p>JavaScript is not likely to become obsolete anytime soon. While newer languages are starting to gain traction, JavaScript will continue to dominate in web development. It’s a universal language that can be used for front-end and back-end development, making it an essential skill for developers.

        <h2>Primary Advantages of JavaScrip</h2>
        As well as with any other technology, there are both advantages and disadvantages of JavaScript. But when it comes to this precise programming language, the disadvantages of JavaScript are fully covered by its benefits, so let’s review them in more detail.
<h5>*Ever-green and popular technology*</h5>
JavaScript has been here for more than 25 years already. And this is just the case when the technology hadn’t become obsolete. Instead, along the path of its development, JavaScript gained a large and supportive community, and the number of its use cases grew.

While there are 1,8 billion websites globally, JS powers 95% of them, and its popularity over time is pretty stable. This is one of the most popular programming languages ever, and because of the updates made by the popular browsers, JavaScript performance becomes even better year after year.

<h5>*Large talent pool*</h5>
Because of the reasons above, one of the benefits of JavaScript is that it has a pretty large talent pool. There are 13,8 million JS developers in the world, and their population continues to grow because of the demand for JS development services and the ease of mastering this technology.

So, if your project is powered by JavaScript, you are unlikely to face a talent shortage. On the contrary, you have the largest talent pool to choose from, and Tino Agency is also here to support you with custom web development using JS and related technologies.
<h5>*Almost versatile nature*</h5>
When used professionally, JavaScript alone will be enough to build both the front and backend of the application. What’s more, JS is perfectly compatible with popular browsers; it allows for creating adaptive designs and is generally platform-independent. That’s why JavaScript is one of the most popular choices for cross-platform development.
<h5>*Rich and creative interfaces to create*</h5>
JavaScript is pretty flexible; it has a lot of room for creativity and effective UI ideas to implement. For example, JS works perfectly for creating stunning sliders, drag and drop features, animations, and other UI components.
<h5>*Tons of tools and frameworks*</h5>
The list of JavaScript advantages can go on and on, but it would be wrong to miss the fact that JS comes with many tools and frameworks to better tailor this programming language to a use case and reveal its best features. For example, the React.js library is the set of ready-made UI elements the developers can instantly reuse. Angular.js is another ever-green framework mostly used to develop websites with complex architectures but still robust performance.

Such a wide range of tools, extensions, frameworks, and libraries greatly streamlines and speeds up the development process with JavaScript, which is one of the main JavaScript benefits.
