    <h2>Speciality of CSS</h2>
    <hr>

        In essence CSS is a freely available standard, sticking to W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) rules and describes a document’s presentation using a markup language. It is now incredibly popular with website owners for creating a page that looks great. The main idea behind it is that the presentation of a site is managed and coded separately from the content of the site which has a major time advantage of being able to change the presentation of multiple pages in one single process. <br>
        The roots of the idea of formulating CSS go back to a proposition by Håkon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994. Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at the time at CERN. There were several other styles that were suggested but CSS became very popular. In all the discussion about different styles, the ‘cascading’ approach in CSS let page managers change multiple sheets or pages at the same time. <br>
        <h1> BROWSER SUPPORTS </h1>
        There were indeed other models that other people were trying to develop at the time. <br> Pei Wei developed a language that derived from the Viola browser and Robert Raisch who worked for the publishing house O’Reilly had managed to put another model together. DSSSL was another model that was a possibility at the time. However, the beauty of the idea of CSS was that it was a partnership between the reader and the web writer. In other words it was the idea that the style of the document could not just be designed by the writer or the reader by themselves, the needs and wishes of both had to be taken into account. The capability of the device that was displaying the content was also absolutely vital in the design.

<p>CSS is used for defining the styles for web pages. It describes the look and formatting of a document which is written in a markup language. It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally used with HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces.

    It is easier to make the web pages presentable using CSS<br>
    . It is easy to learn and understand and used to control the presentation of an HTML document. CSS helps us to control the text color, font style, the spacing between paragraphs, sizing of columns, layout designs, and many more. It is independent of HTML

    It is recommended to use CSS because the HTML attributes
    are being deprecated. So, for making HTML pages compatible with future browsers, it is good to start using CSS in HTML pages.
